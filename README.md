# Diabetes-Prediction.
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project is an end-to-end **Machine Learning web application** that predicts whether a person is likely to have **diabetes** based on health-related inputs provided by the user.

The complete ML pipeline is implemented — from **data analysis and model training** to **deployment using Flask** on **Heroku**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a reliable diabetes prediction system using machine learning.  
Users enter basic medical details through a web form, and the trained ML model predicts whether the person is diabetic or not.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Collect and analyze medical data  
- Perform data preprocessing and visualization  
- Train machine learning models  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Deploy the model as a web application

## 🔁 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Gathering**  
   - Used publicly available medical datasets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Studied patterns, trends, and correlations  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Created charts to understand feature relationships  

4. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Feature scaling and transformation  

5. **Model Training**  
   - Trained multiple ML models  

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compared accuracy and performance metrics  

7. **Model Deployment**  
   - Deployed using Flask and Heroku
